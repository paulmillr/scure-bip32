## Usage

> `npm install @scure/bip32`

> `deno add jsr:@scure/bip32`

> `deno doc jsr:@scure/bip32` # command-line documentation

This module exports a single class `HDKey`, which should be used like this:

```ts
import { HDKey } from '@scure/bip32';
const hdkey1 = HDKey.fromMasterSeed(seed);
const hdkey2 = HDKey.fromExtendedKey(base58key);
const hdkey3 = HDKey.fromJSON({ xpriv: string });

// props
[hdkey1.depth, hdkey1.index, hdkey1.chainCode];
console.log(hdkey2.privateKey, hdkey2.publicKey);
console.log(hdkey3.derive("m/0/2147483647'/1"));
const sig = hdkey3.sign(hash);
hdkey3.verify(hash, sig);
```

Note: `chainCode` property is essentially a private part
of a secret "master" key, it should be guarded from unauthorized access.

The full API is:

```ts
class HDKey {
  public static HARDENED_OFFSET: number;
  public static fromMasterSeed(seed: Uint8Array, versions: Versions): HDKey;
  public static fromExtendedKey(base58key: string, versions: Versions): HDKey;
  public static fromJSON(json: { xpriv: string }): HDKey;

  readonly versions: Versions;
  readonly depth: number = 0;
  readonly index: number = 0;
  readonly chainCode: Uint8Array | null = null;
  readonly parentFingerprint: number = 0;

  get fingerprint(): number;
  get identifier(): Uint8Array | undefined;
  get pubKeyHash(): Uint8Array | undefined;
  get privateKey(): Uint8Array | null;
  get publicKey(): Uint8Array | null;
  get privateExtendedKey(): string;
  get publicExtendedKey(): string;

  derive(path: string): HDKey;
  deriveChild(index: number): HDKey;
  sign(hash: Uint8Array): Uint8Array;
  verify(hash: Uint8Array, signature: Uint8Array): boolean;
  wipePrivateData(): this;
}

interface Versions {
  private: number;
  public: number;
}
```

The module implements [bip32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) standard:
check it out for additional documentation.

The implementation is loosely based on cryptocoinjs/hdkey, [which has MIT License](#LICENSE).

## Security

The library has been independently audited:

- at version 1.0.1, in Jan 2022, by [cure53](https://cure53.de)
  - PDFs: [online](https://cure53.de/pentest-report_hashing-libs.pdf), [offline](./audit/2022-01-05-cure53-audit-nbl2.pdf)
  - [Changes since audit](https://github.com/paulmillr/scure-bip32/compare/1.0.0..main).
  - The audit has been funded by [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.org/en/) with help of [Nomic Labs](https://nomiclabs.io)

The library was initially developed for [js-ethereum-cryptography](https://github.com/ethereum/js-ethereum-cryptography).
At commit [ae00e6d7](https://github.com/ethereum/js-ethereum-cryptography/commit/ae00e6d7d24fb3c76a1c7fe10039f6ecd120b77e),
it was extracted to a separate package called `micro-bip32`.
After the audit we've decided to use `@scure` NPM namespace for security.

### Supply chain security

- **Commits** are signed with PGP keys, to prevent forgery. Make sure to verify commit signatures
- **Releases** are transparent and built on GitHub CI. Make sure to verify [provenance](https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements) logs
- **Rare releasing** is followed to ensure less re-audit need for end-users
- **Dependencies** are minimized and locked-down: any dependency could get hacked and users will be downloading malware with every install.
  - We make sure to use as few dependencies as possible
  - Automatic dep updates are prevented by locking-down version ranges; diffs are checked with `npm-diff`
- **Dev Dependencies** are disabled for end-users; they are only used to develop / build the source code

For this package, there are 3 dependencies; and a few dev dependencies:

- [noble-hashes](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-hashes) provides cryptographic hashing functionality
- [noble-curves](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-curves) provides ECDSA
- [scure-base](https://github.com/paulmillr/scure-base) provides base58
- micro-bmark, micro-should and jsbt are used for benchmarking / testing / build tooling and developed by the same author
- prettier, fast-check and typescript are used for code quality / test generation / ts compilation. It's hard to audit their source code thoroughly and fully because of their size

## Contributing & testing

- `npm install && npm run build && npm test` will build the code and run tests.
- `npm run lint` / `npm run format` will run linter / fix linter issues.
- `npm run build:release` will build single file
